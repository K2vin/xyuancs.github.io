### Overview 
I am currently a Research Fellow in [Department of Compute Science](http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/) at [City University of Hong Kong](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/). I earned my PhD degree from [City University of Hong Kong](http://www.cityu.edu.hk/) under the direction of the incomparable [Cong Wang](http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~congwang/) in August 2016, and I received my MS degree and BS degree from [Illinois Institute of Technology](http://www.iit.edu/) and [Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://www.njupt.edu.cn/) both in Electrical Engineering. Before that, I was graduated from the [High School Affiliated to Nanjing Normal University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Affiliated_to_Nanjing_Normal_University). From 2011 to 2013, I worked at [Stromasys S.A.](http://www.stromasys.com/) as Senior Software Engineer, developing virtual SPARC and ALPHA servers on the x86 platform. 

<br />
My research interests include cloud computing security, network security, mobile security, and hardware security, with the current focus on designing encrypted search techniques for large-scale applications and building secure and practical networked systems.
